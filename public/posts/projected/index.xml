            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-secure-intrusion-detection-system&#34;&gt;Creating Secure Intrusion Detection System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my recent projects is a &lt;strong&gt;Instrusion Detection System&lt;/strong&gt;, designed using pcap files. This project is used to demonstrate the various different details of attacks would look like on intrusion detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-it-does&#34;&gt;What It Does&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is used to analyze various TCP ports, detect malformed packets, payloads, and uses custom snort rules to authenicate events/flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-features&#34;&gt;Key Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Scan Detection&lt;/strong&gt;: Analyzed TCP port scans, characterized traffic patterns, and created custom snort rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malformed Packet Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Identified IP flooding and packet anomalies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malicious Payload Identification&lt;/strong&gt;: Used Wireshark to detect and analyze malicious payloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Snort Rules&lt;/strong&gt;: Developed rules for TFTP write requests and RADIUS authentication events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are given capture files, which can be used to create your own custom snort rules in order to detect intrusions, as well as analyze in wireshark. Group 1 capture is used for port scanning to find packet anomalies. Group 2 is used as a capture to help demonstrate the appearance of malformed packets. Group 3 is used to detect malicious payloads through snort. Finally, Group 4 is used to create your own custom snort rules to detection instrusions into the system which can send alerts and detect anomalies/attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Static Website on Azure</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/projected/projects/</link>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;static-website-hosted-on-azure&#34;&gt;Static Website Hosted on Azure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project demonstrates hosting a static website using &lt;strong&gt;Azure Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a cost-effective and efficient way to deploy static sites, complete with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-features&#34;&gt;Key Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;: The website is hosted on Azure Cloud, a scalable and reliable solution for static content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI/CD Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Automated deployments ensure seamless updates whenever changes are pushed to the repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Domain with HTTPS&lt;/strong&gt;: The website is secured with a custom domain and HTTPS for a professional touch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website is built using static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and deployed to Azure Cloud Platform. The CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment process, making it easy to update the site with new content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>DVD-Inspired Screensaver with Java</title>
            <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/projected/projects1/</link>

            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;recreating-the-classic-dvd-screensaver-in-java&#34;&gt;Recreating the Classic DVD Screensaver in Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my recent projects is a &lt;strong&gt;DVD-inspired screensaver&lt;/strong&gt;, built using Java. This project is a nostalgic nod to the iconic bouncing DVD logo that many of us remember from the early 2000s. It’s a simple yet fun application that combines graphics programming with user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-it-does&#34;&gt;What It Does&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screensaver replicates the classic DVD logo animation. The logo bounces around the screen, changing direction and color whenever it hits the edges. It’s a lightweight program that runs smoothly, thanks to Java’s graphics libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="what-it-does">What It Does</h3>
<p>The screensaver replicates the classic DVD logo animation. The logo bounces around the screen, changing direction and color whenever it hits the edges. It’s a lightweight program that runs smoothly, thanks to Java’s graphics libraries.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Color Changes</strong>: The logo changes color every time it hits the edge of the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Edge Detection</strong>: The program ensures the logo bounces accurately off the screen boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Speed</strong>: Users can adjust the speed of the logo to their preference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>
<p>The program uses Java’s built-in graphics libraries to handle rendering and animation. The logo’s position is updated in real-time, and edge collisions trigger both a direction change and a color update.</p>
