## Static Website Hosted on Azure

This project demonstrates hosting a static website using **Azure Cloud Platform**. Itâ€™s a cost-effective and efficient way to deploy static sites, complete with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

### Key Features
- **Azure Cloud Platform**: The website is hosted on Azure Cloud, a scalable and reliable solution for static content.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployments ensure seamless updates whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
- **Custom Domain with HTTPS**: The website is secured with a custom domain and HTTPS for a professional touch.

### How It Works
The website is built using static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and deployed to Azure Cloud Platform. The CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment process, making it easy to update the site with new content.
