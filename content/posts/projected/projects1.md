## Recreating the Classic DVD Screensaver in Java

One of my recent projects is a **DVD-inspired screensaver**, built using Java. This project is a nostalgic nod to the iconic bouncing DVD logo that many of us remember from the early 2000s. It’s a simple yet fun application that combines graphics programming with user interaction.

### What It Does
The screensaver replicates the classic DVD logo animation. The logo bounces around the screen, changing direction and color whenever it hits the edges. It’s a lightweight program that runs smoothly, thanks to Java’s graphics libraries.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Color Changes**: The logo changes color every time it hits the edge of the screen.
- **Smooth Edge Detection**: The program ensures the logo bounces accurately off the screen boundaries.
- **Customizable Speed**: Users can adjust the speed of the logo to their preference.

### How It Works
The program uses Java’s built-in graphics libraries to handle rendering and animation. The logo’s position is updated in real-time, and edge collisions trigger both a direction change and a color update.

### Try It Yourself
You can find the full code and instructions on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kneeble/DVDInspiredScreensaver). Feel free to clone the project, run it locally, or even tweak it to add your own features!
